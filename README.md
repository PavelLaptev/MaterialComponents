# MaterialComponents version 1

Easily create, use and modify various Material Design components using this simple module. All of the components are design according to eh Material Design Guidelines — hopefully making your prototyping life a little easier.

— FULL DISCLOSURE —
1. While I tried to follow the Material Design guidelines as closely as possible — I probably made a mistake here or there where it doesn’t follow the guidelines exactly.
2. This is my first module that I have shared — and there are still lots (x100) of bugs, especially where icons are involved.

This version contains
1. Color
2. FlatButton
3. RaisedButton
4. FAB
5. Checkboxes
6. Radio Buttons
7. Switch
8. TextField (frankenstiend from Jordan Robert Dobson's InputField)
9. TextField_Validation (frankenstiend from Jordan Robert Dobson's InputField)
10. TextArea (frankenstiend from Jordan Robert Dobson's InputField and Blaine Billingsley's Autogrow)
11. TextField_Dropdown
12. AppBar

installation:
1. put the MaterialComponents.coffee in the 'modules' folder of your prototype.
2. in your prototype in Framer, add: MaterialComponents = require 'MaterialComponents'
3. create components by just going: button = new MaterialComponents.RaisedButton

Enjoy! and let me know if you find any bugs, x
